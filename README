awget retrieves a file over a network like wget. However, awget uses a list of 
intermediate servers to hide the origin of the request. awget takes a URL as an
argument as well as an optional argument which is a list of IP addresses and 
ports which give the IP's of servers running the ss program explained below.
URL must be a full file path.

awget usage:
awget URL [-c CHAINFILE]

ss is a server companion to awget. ss listens for connections on an optional
port and then reads a file retrieval request from that port in the format of
a URL and a list of IP's and ports, which give further stepping stones.

ss usage:
ss [-p PORT]



Other notes:
There is no awget.h but core.h should have what awget.h should have had.
